To identify online payment fraud with machine learning, we need to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. For this, I am using a dataset containing information about online payment fraud, so that we can understand what type of transactions lead to fraud. It contains historical information about fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments. Below are all the columns from the dataset Iâ€™m using here: step: represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour type: type of online transaction amount: the amount of the transaction nameOrig: customer starting the transaction oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction nameDest: recipient of the transaction oldbalanceDest: initial balance of recipient before the transaction newbalanceDest: the new balance of recipient after the transaction isFraud: fraud transaction
